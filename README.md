Children at the age of 3 to 5 years, start to learn language writing by tracing over alphabets (dots marked on books to create an alphabet). However, this learning process is not very effective in engaging children for active and creative learning. The aim of the project was to make an alternative for tracing activity sheet. AR tracing app, which is an application of Augmented Reality, creates interactive learning environment for children.
 Demo Video is also given - App_demo.
 Open the project with Unity3d and generate apk file for your android phone.
